3. Now define strings.xml to define questions and button texts

4. Define the activity_quiz.xml with Layout information.  The TextView and Buttons must have ID associated with it so that it can be accessed from Activity.

5. Define the methods in Activity to handle the following

     1.	Initialize Questions
     2.	 Define listeners for True , False , Next and Previous Buttons
     3.	In the case of True / False buttons, display a Toast message to show the correctness of selection
